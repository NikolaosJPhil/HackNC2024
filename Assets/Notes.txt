We'll split the rocket into its ocmponents
Each type of component will have its associated class
Each instance of a component has a modifier it contributes to the entire spaceship.

-Main Body: Acts as the core of the ship and all other parts must attach to it. May have a built in thruster and fuel tank.
-Sub Body: Attaches to the main body. Can act as another connection point for other parts.
-Thruster: What makes the ship "go". More powerful thrusters can carry hervier loads.

Camera follows rocket. ground is static
Can sever smaller boosters and nay other additional components while in flight.

Every component can return a center of mass, rotation, and an acceleration vector

       --Thruster--

During launch (while rocket is in motion) / when button is pressed
- fuel decreases
- weight decreases IF part of the rocket falls off 
- Velocity should increase until it runs out of gravity, remains constant for a bit, when velocity reaches 0 - game over
- Acceleration... (9.8 m/s is gravity) 
- Power of thrust must be greater than weight*gravity 

Generally: 400000 kg fuel needed for 34.5 million Newtons of thrust causes it to be in the air for 3 days
Smaller scale: 408 kg of fuel needed for 4002 Newtons of thrust causes it to be in the air for ~400 seconds
How much fuel and thrust the rocket uses
- it burns about 11,000 
Weight of each component
- (90% of a rocket's weight is fuel) 
ex. 117,020 kg at takeoff -> 4760 kg final weight
- 1 liter of fuel = 45 N of thrust
- engine weight: ~ 400 kg - 9750 kg
- thruster weight: ~ 5,000 kg - 10,000 kg 
-Rocket fuel density = 810g/L
Typical Rockets burn fuel at 100 kg per second
Size of a Rocket
~ 82 ft tall - 400 ft tall
770000 liters of fuel for 34.5 million Newtons
Basically, the name of each rocket component is used to identify a separate object in a scene.
