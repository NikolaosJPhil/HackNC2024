We'll split the rocket into its ocmponents
Each type of component will have its associated class
Each instance of a component has a modifier it contributes to the entire spaceship.

-Main Body: Acts as the core of the ship and all other parts must attach to it. May have a built in thruster and fuel tank.
-Sub Body: Attaches to the main body. Can act as another connection point for other parts.
-Thruster: What makes the ship "go". More powerful thrusters can carry hervier loads.

Camera follows rocket. ground is static
Can sever smaller boosters and nay other additional components while in flight.

Every component can return a center of mass, rotation, and an acceleration vector

        --Rocket--

        --Engine--
        
       --Thruster--

During launch (while rocket is in motion) / when button is pressed
- fuel decreases
- weight decreases IF part of the rocket falls off 
- Velocity should increase until it runs out of gravity, remains constant for a bit, when velocity reaches 0 - game over
- Acceleration... (9.8 m/s is gravity) 
- Power of thrust must be greater than weight*gravity 
- 


Basically, the name of each rocket component is used to identify a separate object in a scene.
